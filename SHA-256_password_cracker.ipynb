    "Firstly I learnt about how the SHA-256 hashing algorithm works. I learnt that SHA-256 is a *one-way* function, meaning that it’s computationally infeasible to reverse a hash back into its original value. This is good for security, but it means I couldn’t just “decode” the hash directly. \n",

    "\n",
    "For this project, I didn’t need to install any extra libraries because Python’s built-in `hashlib` library includes SHA-256 hashing functionality. I created a small project folder, placed my `sha256_cracker.py` script inside, and added a `wordlist.txt` file containing a list of test passwords. I used a list of commonly used passwords for this test, but in a real-world scenario, attackers might use much larger wordlists or sophisticated techniques to generate password candidates.\n"

    "Using complex passwords (e.g., mixing letters, numbers, and special characters).\n",
